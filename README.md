# Wildfire-Prevention
Multiple-Linear Regression algorithm which identifies and predicts areas at high risk of wildfire. 

This algorithm was written in Python and in order to run you will need the following packages:
  1. Pandas
  2. Bs4
  3. Requests
  4. Scikit-learn
  5. Plotly

Before running the main file, you must first run the generate_data file to make a csv learning file for your machine learning model.
You can change the number of lines of data generated, but its default is 20,000.

When running both files, be aware that it may take a while for the program to finish.
